        <h1> James Crocker's Corner of The Web </h1>
        <p> Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is James Crocker, and I am a Senior Engineering Physics major and Computer Science Minor at Loyola Marymount University. This site is mostly for me to showcase my various projects, in greater detail than could be jammed onto my resume. </p>
		<ul>
            <li> <h2> <a href="WebLife.html"> Langton's Ant </a></h2>
                <p> I figured if I was going to make a website, I better learn some JavaScript. And what better way to do that than make a fund little toy? This fun little cellular automata can be imagined as an ant, who changes the color of each space he steps on in a cyclic pattern, the color of which determines his next move. It displays chaotic behavior for a very long time, but eventually converges to a repeating pattern. </p>
            </li>
			<li> <h2> <a href="https://github.com/NamesAreAPain/MersenneTwister"> Pseudorandom Number Generator</a></h2>
                <p> While working on another project, in the process of learning Elixir, I wanted to generate independent seeded streams of psuedorandom numbers. This turned out to be a problem, as the idiomatic way of generating random numbers in Elixir is to call Erlang directly, which lacked the elegance I wanted. To rememedy this, I wrote a quick native implementation of the Mersenne Twister algorithm.
			<li> <h2> <a href="CircuitOptimizer.html"> Circuit Optimizer</a></h2>
				<p> In order to get better aquainted with the high-performance scientific computing language Julia, and because designing amplifier circuits is about as fun as single-player pattycake, I wrote a program that, given a circuit topography defined in SPICE, adjusts component values in order to optimize towards defined reward functions. </p> 
			</li>
			<li> <h2> <a href="WorldGenerator.html"> World Generator </a></h2>
			    <p> A co-conspirator and I decided we wanted to make a Medieval economy simulator, and maybe stick a game on top of it. Though no economics were ever simulated, I did end up building a pretty cool world generator. It uses blue-noise point sampling (inspired by <a href="https://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/"> this </a> article) and involves some pretty cool computational geometry. </p>
			</li>
            <li> <h2> <a href="NetwonianSimulator.html"> 2D Newtonian Physics Simulator </a></h2>
                <p> Freshman year we were given an open-ended assignment for our intro to MATLAB course. I decided to make a general motion model for point-masses connected by thin massless rods. This was a bad idea, as nothing over a thousand lines should be written in MATLAB. But I digress. It works, and I spent a lot of time on it, so I'll list it here. </p>
